## Open-Source LLM Models Evaluation

### Gemini 2.0 Flash

Gemini had a fast processing, but it couldn't accept CSV or XLSX files as input. So, I had to convert it to a PDF file to feed into it.
At first, it did a thorough analysis on the dataset and provided the responses.
As we kept increasing the number of prompts, the reponses's relativeness to the dataset got lesser.
It didn't provide any visualization even when asked.

### DeepSeek
Deepseek couldn't read the complete dataset, it would only read 6% of the whole CSV file in Video Games Dataset.
I had used the R1 model to ask for the responses.
The R1 model made it much easier to see what's going on in the background. It was able to provide structured responses utilizing all the aspects of the dataset.
But Gemini was much faster than Deepseek R1.

### Qwen
Qwen was also able to provide the background processes using it's thinking feature. 
Qwen's response was much "analytics" oriented than deepseek and gemini, making it's responses much better.
Qwen and deepseek have the same average response time, but both are slower compared to Gemini


### Speed
- Gemini > Deepseek ~ Qwen

### Relativeness to dataset
- Qwen > Deepseek > Gemini

### Response Satisfaction
- Qwen > Deepseek > Gemini
